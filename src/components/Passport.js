            <p>Hello! I am the Island Representative of SobyLand.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>As 2021 wrapped up, I began thinking about my ideas for the new year! Tom Nook's flyer was popped into my mailbox some weeks before and had been sitting on top of a pile of unopened letters by my desk. I decided it was time to leave the sweater-weather and chilly beach breezes of San Francisco for a new adventure!</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>A deserted island sounded like the perfect place to start the new year with a clean slate! I would still have the beautiful beaches and green parks from my Bay Area home, but they would be at the mercy of my own decoration whims.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>SobyLand's native fruit is the orange, although most of the orchards now host peaches. It's native flower is the tulip, and the southeastern side of the island boasts a beautiful flower garden blooming with rare and collectible tulip colors.</p>
